The 0 0
leaf 0 1

The 0 0

can 0 0

As 0 0
compared 0 0

our 0 0

demonstrate 0 0
that 0 0

As 0 0
shown 0 0
in 0 0
this 0 0

, 0 0
periodic 0 1
oscillations 0 1
are 0 0
mainly 0 0
generated 0 0
by 0 0
nonlinearly 0 1
negative 0 1
and 0 0
positive 0 1
feedback 0 1
loops 0 1
in 0 0

systems 0 1
, 0 0
whereas 0 0
the 0 0

a 0 0
genetic 0 1

in 0 0

on 0 0
the 0 0

the 0 0

showing 0 0
that 0 0
the 0 0

the 0 0

Consider 0 0
a 0 0
situation 0 0
in 0 0
which 0 0
a 0 0
quantum 0 1
system 0 1
is 0 0
secretly 0 1
prepared 0 1
in 0 0
a 0 0

chosen 0 0
from 0 0
the 0 0

We 0 0
present 0 0
a 0 0
principle 0 0
that 0 0
gives 0 0
a 0 0
definite 0 0

those 0 0
that 0 0

The 0 0
principle 0 0
is 0 0
derived 0 0
by 0 0
alternately 0 0
applying 0 0
a 0 0
fundamental 0 0
property 0 0
of 0 1
classical 0 1
signals 0 1
and 0 0
a 0 0
fundamental 0 0
property 0 0
of 0 1
quantum 0 1
ones 0 0
. 0 0
The 0 0
principle 0 0
can 0 0
be 0 0
cast 0 0
into 0 0
a 0 0
simple 0 0
form 0 0
by 0 0
using 0 0
a 0 0
decomposition 0 0
of 0 1

which 0 0
is 0 0
uniquely 0 0
determined 0 0
by 0 0
the 0 0
set 0 0
of 0 1
possible 0 0
states 0 1
. 0 0
The 0 0
decomposition 0 0
implies 0 0
the 0 0
classification 0 0
of 0 1
the 0 0
degrees 0 1
of 0 1
freedom 0 1
of 0 1
the 0 0
system 0 1
into 0 0
three 0 0
parts 0 0
depending 0 0
on 0 0
how 0 0
they 0 0
store 0 0
the 0 0
information 0 0
on 0 0
the 0 0
initially 0 0
chosen 0 0
state 0 1
: 0 0
one 0 0
storing 0 0
it 0 0
classically 0 0
, 0 0
one 0 0
storing 0 0
it 0 0
nonclassically 0 0
, 0 0
and 0 0
the 0 0
other 0 0
one 0 0
storing 0 0
no 0 0
information 0 0
. 0 0
Then 0 0
the 0 0
principle 0 0
states 0 1
that 0 0
the 0 0
nonclassical 0 1
part 0 1
is 0 0
inaccessible 0 0
and 0 0
the 0 0
classical 0 1
part 0 1
is 0 0
read-only 0 0
if 0 0
we 0 0
are 0 0

we 0 0
propose 0 0
a 0 0
robust 0 1
self-tuning 0 1
PID 0 1
controller 0 1
suitable 0 0
for 0 0
nonlinear 0 1
systems 0 1
. 0 0
The 0 0

employs 0 0
a 0 0

in 0 0

However 0 0

it 0 0
also 0 0

In 0 0

instead 0 0

viewing 0 0
the 0 0

as 0 0
an 0 0

, 0 0
we 0 0
use 0 0
it 0 0
as 0 0
a 0 0
naturally 0 1
occurring 0 1
signal 0 1
for 0 0
tuning 0 1
and 0 0

PID 0 1
controller 0 1
is 0 0
tuned 0 0
for 0 0
a 0 0
particular 0 0
operating 0 1
point 0 0
, 0 0
the 0 0

may 0 0
be 0 0
disabled 0 0
and 0 0
chattering 0 1
ceases 0 0
correspondingly 0 0

proposes 0 0
a 0 0

In 0 0

the 0 0

blending 0 1

discussed 0 0

A 0 0
new 0 0

derived 0 0
by 0 0
each 0 0

Then 0 0
the 0 0
approach 0 0
is 0 0
employed 0 0
both 0 0
to 0 0
blend 0 0

to 0 0

It 0 0
is 0 0
easy 0 0
to 0 0
produce 0 0
piecewise-smooth 0 1
subdivision 0 1
surfaces 0 1
with 0 0
both 0 0
convex 0 0

concave 0 0

the 0 0

are 0 0

A 1 0

class 1 0
Every 0 0
C++ 0 1
program 0 1
that 0 0
uses 0 0
inheritance 0 1
must 0 0
manage 0 0
memory 0 0
somehow 0 0
. 0 0
The 0 0
most 0 0
obvious 0 0
way 0 0
to 0 0
do 0 0
so 0 0
is 0 0
directly 0 0
, 0 0
but 0 0
programmers 0 0
who 0 0
create 0 0
complicated 0 0
data 0 0
structures 0 0
often 0 0
have 0 0
trouble 0 0
figuring 0 0
out 0 0

those 0 0
data 0 0
structures 0 0
are 0 0
safe 0 0
to 0 0
delete 0 0
when 0 0
. 0 0
The 0 0
classical 0 0
method 0 0
of 0 0
dealing 0 0
with 0 0
such 0 0
complexity 0 0
is 0 0
to 0 0
hide 0 0
it 0 0
in 0 0
a 0 0
class 0 0
. 0 0
Such 0 0
classes 0 0
are 0 0
typically 0 0
called 0 0
handles 0 1
; 0 0
the 0 0
idea 0 0
is 0 0
to 0 0
attach 0 0
a 0 0
handle 0 0
object 0 0
to 0 0
another 0 0
object 0 0
that 0 0
contains 0 0
the 0 0
actual 0 0
data 0 0

The 0 0
simplest 0 0
form 0 0
of 0 0
a 0 0
handle 0 0
, 0 0
which 0 0
we 0 0
have 0 0
discussed 0 0
in 0 0
this 0 0
article 0 0
, 0 0
is 0 0
one 0 0
in 0 0
which 0 0
each 0 0
handle 0 0
object 0 0
corresponds 0 0
to 0 0
a 0 0
single 0 0
object 0 0
from 0 0
the 0 0
inheritance 0 1
hierarchy 0 1
. 0 0
Such 0 0
handles 0 1
are 0 0
straightforward 0 0
to 0 0
use 0 0
and 0 0
to 0 0
implement 0 0
and 0 0
tend 0 0
to 0 0
be 0 0
intrinsically 0 0
exception 0 1
safe 0 0
in 0 0
almost 0 0
all 0 0
respects 0 0
. 0 0
The 0 0
one 0 0
exception 0 1
hazard 0 0
in 0 0
such 0 0
a 0 0
class 0 0
is 0 0
typically 0 0
the 0 0
assignment 0 1
operator 0 1
. 0 0
Assignment 0 0

test 0 0
for 0 0

. 0 0
As 0 0
Herb 0 0
Sutter 0 0
has 0 0
observed 0 0
( 0 0
2000 0 0
) 0 0
, 0 0
programs 0 0
that 0 0
need 0 0
such 0 0
tests 0 0
are 0 0
almost 0 0
always 0 0
exception 0 1
unsafe 0 0
. 0 0
By 0 0
rewriting 0 0
the 0 0
assignment 0 1
operator 0 1
, 0 0
we 0 0
ensure 0 0
that 0 0
we 0 0
do 0 0
not 0 0
do 0 0
anything 0 0
irrevocable 0 0
until 0 0
the 0 0
possibility 0 0
of 0 0
throwing 0 0
an 0 0
exception 0 1
has 0 0
passed 0 0
. 0 0
This 0 0
strategy 0 0
ensures 0 0
that 0 0
if 0 0
an 0 0

occurs 0 0
while 0 0
our 0 0

The 0 0

states 0 0
that 0 0

can 0 0
not 0 0

a 0 0

constructor 0 0
or 0 0

. 0 0
While 0 0
at 0 0
first 0 0
this 0 0
seems 0 0
unreasonable 0 0
, 0 0
further 0 0
thought 0 0
makes 0 0
it 0 0
clear 0 0
why 0 0
this 0 0
is 0 0
the 0 0
case 0 0
: 0 0
The 0 0
crux 0 0
of 0 0
the 0 0
problem 0 0
is 0 0
that 0 0
unions 0 0
do 0 0
n't 0 0
have 0 0
built-in 0 0
semantics 0 0
for 0 0
denoting 0 0
when 0 0
a 0 0

is 0 0
the 0 0
`` 0 0
current 0 0
'' 0 0
member 0 0
of 0 0
the 0 0

Therefore 0 0
, 0 0
the 0 0
compiler 0 0
ca 0 0
n't 0 0
know 0 0
when 0 0
it 0 0
's 0 0

call 0 0
constructors 0 1
or 0 0
destructors 0 1
on 0 0
the 0 0
union 0 1
members 0 1
. 0 0
Still 0 0
, 0 0
there 0 0
are 0 0
good 0 0
reasons 0 0
for 0 0
wanting 0 0
to 0 0
use 0 0
constructed 0 0
object 0 0

in 0 0
a 0 0
union 0 1

For 0 0

for 0 0

but 0 0
the 0 0
restriction 0 0
on 0 0

idea 0 0
of 0 0

, 0 0
that 0 0
not 0 0

are 0 0
these 0 0
two 0 0
consistent 0 0
, 0 0
but 0 0
that 0 0
the 0 0
latter 0 0
( 0 0
the 0 0
realist 0 0
conception 0 0
of 0 0

) 0 0
provides 0 0
the 0 0
most 0 0
